In our first Snappy Playpen event last Tuesday we simply wanted to bring
people together, invite them to get to know the team, get started together and
see how things go. It went great, check out [the
report!](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2016/06/08/snappy-playpen-
kickoff-highlights/)

Next week, on _Tuesday, 14th June_, we want to meet up and snap software
together again. Obviously you can join [#snappy on
Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=snappy) or the [playpen gitter
channel](https://gitter.im/ubuntu/snappy-playpen) (or contribute to [Snappy
Playpen](https://github.com/ubuntu/snappy-playpen)) at any time, but on
Tuesday we want to get everyone together and make another push to get good
stuff landed together.

This time we want to especially extend the invitation to all upstreams who are
interested in getting their software snapped. If you are interested and need
help, join us and we will figure out things together. If you still need to be
convinced, here are a few reasons why this might make sense for your project:

  * Just run snapcraft upload to upload a snap to the store. (Maybe even hook it up with your CI?)
  * No lengthy review process. Publication within seconds.
  * Use different channels (stable, beta, edge) to ship different versions of your software to different audiences.
  * Build instructions in snapcraft.yaml are very simple, all nice and declarative.
  * Millions of Ubuntu 16.04 users can easily install your software through the software center.

We would also like to invite all Ubuntu flavours to participate. If you want
to play around with snaps, we will help you get started.

  * WHAT: Snappy playpen sprint
  * WHEN: Tuesday, 14th June 2016 all day
  * WHERE: Join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ubuntu/snappy-playpen) or [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=snappy)
