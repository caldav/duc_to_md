![Get started with Snappy](https://developer.ubuntu.com/static/devportal_uploaded/82bd298b-6324-4c6e-854f-0dc60ebac9d3-cms_page_media/1132/g5095.png)

The [Snappy Playpen is hosted in github](https://github.com/ubuntu/snappy-playpen) and we meet in both #snappy on Freenode and [our gitterchannel](https://gitter.im/ubuntu/snappy-playpen). We are hanging out there
most of the time, but next week on Tuesday, 21st June we will get all experts
in one room and together we will make a push to get both

  * [Electron based apps](http://electron.atom.io/apps/) and
  * server apps

snapped. Obviously you can bring whatever own app you are interested in.
Particularly if you are an upstream of a project, we're keen to help you get
started.

Snaps are a beautiful and simple way to get your app out to users, so let's
make this happen together.

If you are curious and want to take a first look, go to
[https://snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io) and we'll take care of the
questions together.

  * WHAT: Snappy playpen sprint
  * WHEN: Tuesday, 21st June 2016 all day
  * WHERE: Join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ubuntu/snappy-playpen) or [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=snappy)
