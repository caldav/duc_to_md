#  [A Fast Thumbnailer for Ubuntu](/en/blog/2015/08/17/fast-thumbnailer-ubuntu/)

Over the past few months, [James Henstridge](https://launchpad.net/~jamesh),
[Xavi Garcia Mena](https://launchpad.net/~xavi-garcia-mena), and I have
implemented a fast and scalable [thumbnailingservice](https://launchpad.net/thumbnailer) for Ubuntu and Ubuntu Touch. This
post explains how we did it, and how we achieved our performance and
reliability goals.

## Introduction

On a phone as well as the desktop, applications need to display image ...

## Convergent applications

We want to make it easy for app developers to write an app that can run on
different form factors without changes in the code. This implies that an app
should support screens of various sizes, and the layout of the app should be
optimal for each screen size. For example, a messaging ...

To celebrate the Developer Edition Ubuntu phone launch in China, Canonical
organized a “celebrate Ubuntu” hackathon for phone in Beijing. It is also
hosted as part of the on-going [_China Mobile & Ubuntu Developer Innovation Contest_](http://dream.10086.cn/yecp/match?action=ubuntu&f=ubuntupr&hmsr=ubuntupr), all projects that were coded during the hackathon can be submitted into
the contest afterwards. This 30+ hour ...

#  [Add a C++ backend to your QML UI](/en/blog/2015/07/01/add-c-backend-your-qml-ui/)

Whether you are creating a new app or porting an existing one from another
ecosystem, you may need more backend power than the QML + JavaScript duo
proposed in the [QML apptutorial](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/apps/qml/tutorials/building-your-first-qml-app/).

Let's have a peek at how to to add a C++ backend to your application, using
system libraries or your own, and vastly ...

#  [Cleaning up scopes settings](/en/blog/2015/06/11/cleaning-scopes-settings/)

The scopes architecture on Unity 7, which provides the Ubuntu shell and
default UX experience on current desktops, and Unity 8, which powers the phone
and soon the convergent desktop, differ to a large degree when it comes to
visibility of data sources. Future Unity 8 builds will be obsoleting the
legacy privacy flag in ...

#  [Sprinting for convergence](/en/blog/2015/06/08/sprinting-convergence/)

Convergence is all around. Our deeply loved UI Toolkit, what was primarily
targeting touch environments is converging to where users might have keyboards
and pointer devices. But that is just one point. The innovative track for
Ubuntu is called Snappy and at the same time the SDK is converging to the
desktop. We move to ...

#  [Turning node.js projects into snap packages](/en/blog/2015/06/02/turning-nodejs-projects-snap-packages/)

Thanks to the tireless work of Oliver Grawert we now have a handy tool called
node-snapper which very easily turns your node.js project into a .snap
package. It will automatically take care of bundling required libraries, other
related node.js projects and will make a multi-arch ("fat") package available,
so it will immediately work ...

#  [Keeping track of evolving QML components](/en/blog/2015/05/26/keeping-track-evolving-qml-components/)

We all love QML because it allows for fast prototyping, and not only that,
it's a very efficient tool for production applications. The complexity of C
and C++ is hidden behind neat and simple API. Many if not most app developers
these days take advantage of that without even having to know the
implementation details ...
