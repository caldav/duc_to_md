#  [Using the ubuntu-app-platform content interface in appsnaps](/en/blog/2016/11/29/using-ubuntu-app-platform-content-interface-in-app-snaps/)

Recently the ubuntu-app-platform snap has been made available in the store for
application developers to build their snaps without bundling all their
dependencies. The ubuntu-app-platform snap includes standard Qt libraries
(version 5.6.1 as of this writing) and QML runtime, the ubuntu UI toolkit and
related dependencies, and oxide (a web engine based on ...

#  [Ubuntu SDK meets snapcraft](/en/blog/2016/11/16/ubuntu-sdk-ide-meets-snapcraft/)

Everyone who has followed Ubuntu lately for sure stumbled across the snappy
technology, which does not only bring the new cross-distro packaging format
“snap” but also a sandboxing technology for apps, as well as transactional
updates that can be rolled back in case of an update going wrong and a new way
of installing and ...

#  [How to create Snap packages of Qtapplications](/en/blog/2016/11/16/snapping-qt-apps/)

## Introduction

One of the advantages of snap packages is that they are self-contained. When
you install a snap, you know that you don’t need to install additional
dependencies (besides the automatically-installed core snap that provides the
basic operating system layer), and it will simply work on every Linux
distribution that supports snaps.

Here, we show ...

#  [Learning to snap with codelabs](/en/blog/2016/09/27/learning-to-snap-with-codelabs/)

**The background**

I always felt that learning something new, especially new concepts and
workflows usually works best if you see it first-hand and get to do things
yourself. If you experience directly how your actions influence the system
you're working with, the new connections in your brain form much more quickly.

#  [Announcing new snap desktop launchers](/en/blog/2016/07/06/announcing-new-snap-desktop-launchers/)

## Background

Integrating desktop applications with snaps has been a little bit challenging
in terms of getting them looking and behaving as part of the system. This
means following general desktop theming, having global application menu
integration, getting the icon caches, getting configuration keys and such.
Also, the technologies and toolkits like GTK, Qt, demand a little bit of
expertise on ...
