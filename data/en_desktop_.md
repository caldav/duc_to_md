### 1-min FAQ

#### Does it work in any desktop environment?

This feature is primarily targeted at Ubuntu 16.04 LTS desktop and server.
Nevertheless, this doesn't prevent it from working with other desktops, Ubuntu
flavours, derivatives and other Linux distributions such as Arch, Debian,
Gentoo, Fedora, Open Suse, etc.

#### How does this fit with Unity 8 and the convergent desktop?

Unity 8 is the codebase that will eventually bring all projects under the same
convergent interface, it is the future of Ubuntu and this feature will work
there as well in due time. Note that you can test Unity8 as a technology
preview in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

#### Are snaps replacing click and deb packages?

Snaps are the next generation of app distribution technology for all Ubuntu
devices. After an IoT and smart appliances focused launch, we are now
introducing them as a technology preview on the classic desktop and server.
Click packages are still the default in phone and tablet environments
(Unity8-based) and Debian packages are still at the core of Ubuntu desktop and
server.
