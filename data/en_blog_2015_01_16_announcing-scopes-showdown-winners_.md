We're thrilled to announce the results of the **Ubuntu Scope Showdown**: a
contest to develop a [scope](http://developer.ubuntu.com/scopes) in 6 weeks
and win exciting prizes. Fleshing out Ubuntu's innovative take at the content
and services experience, participants had the opportunity to use the new
development tools to create a complete scope from scratch and publish it to
the store in just a few weeks.

The **Cinema Scope** by [Daniele Laudani](http://danslair.me/) is the winner
of this Scope Showdown edition. Daniele's scope scored the best judge ratings
for its visual appeal, usability, general interest and use of scope features.
To him goes the **Dell XPS 13 developer laptop preloaded with Ubuntu**. Enjoy!

## Outstanding runner ups

The quality of all winning scopes was impressive, which resulted in a draw in
some of the runner ups. In the end, rather than a tie break, we decided to**
include an extra prize** as a recognition to their outstanding work. And
without further ado, we're proud to present the additional winners.

## Scopes everywhere

Congratulations to all winners, and to all participants: everyone did a
fantastic job. Given the early adoption of scopes and developer tools, judges
and reviewers were particularly impressed by the quality of the submissions.

Remember you can install any of the winner scopes and more from the Ubuntu
Software Store. It's now time to start thinking beyond the apps grid and
bringing interesting scopes that enable Ubuntu phone users to get the data
that matters to them. Looking forward to seeing scopes everywhere!
