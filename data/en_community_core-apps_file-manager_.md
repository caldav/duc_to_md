# File Manager

File Manager is a powerful but familiar tool for managing files. File Manager
supports typical operations like cut/copy/paste and supports removable storage
where available. File Manager makes effective use of space on small form
factor devices, and expands to use more space on larger displays.

File Manager is written in QML and C++ using the Ubuntu SDK and is licensed
under the GPLv3.
