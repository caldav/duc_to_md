# Meetings

Core Apps meet regularly on IRC in [#ubuntu-touch-meeting](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ubuntu-touch-meeting&uio=d4). We use these meetings to catch up, plan and unblock problems
in each of the Core Applications.

Everyone is welcome to the public meetings which are at the times listed
below. Sometimes we also meet using Google Hangouts, and if that's the case,
the link will be shared during the meeting. If you'd like to join in, but are
unavailable at the time listed, we may be able to move the meeting, or just
have additional conversations on [#ubuntu-app-devel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ubuntu-app-devel&uio=d4) on
freenode.
