This section will give you an overview on how to update your application with
a new version if it's already in the Ubuntu Software Centre.

  1. Go to [My Apps](https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/)
  2. Click on the entry for the application you are trying to update
  3. On the '**Overview**' tab for your app, scroll down to the '**Your app**' section
  4. Click on the '**Edit**' link
  5. Use the '**Your application**' field's '**Browse...**' button to navigate to your updated app's location and upload it. You can also learn more about [what you should upload](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/my-apps-packages/).
  6. Click on the '**Save Changes**' button

## Next steps: review and publish

After you've done this, your application's update will not be rolled out
immediately on the Software Centre. Instead, an application change request
will be triggered to notify the reviewers.

When the reviewer signs in and looks at the list of applications awaiting
review, this change request will be listed there.

The reviewer will then able to download the updated app's archive, package it
if necessary and upload to the Software Centre. If the update is not working
or unsuitable, the app developer (you) will be notified.

As soon as the new package is uploaded, all users around the world will get
the update installed with their regular software updates, so usually the
reviewer should approve the change request as soon as the package is uploaded,
as it's effectively already approved.

**Note:**

This article refers to publishing third-party desktop applications packaged
with the traditional .deb format.

Ubuntu is migrating to the new .snap format to easily and securely distribute
apps.
