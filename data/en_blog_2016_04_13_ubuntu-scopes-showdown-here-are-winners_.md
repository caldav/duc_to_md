After a month of deliberations, it's time to announce the Scopes Showdown 2016
winners!

It's been a blast to see the interaction this contest has generated between
scopes developers and the scopes API team, many bugs have been fixed,
contributions have been accepted and many suggestions have been considered for
inclusion and are now on the roadmap (which will be discussed during the next
[Ubuntu Online Summit](http://summit.ubuntu.com/))!

About half of the accepted entries are using [the new JavaScript
API](/phone/scopes/tutorials), which is very exciting, to say the least. All
developers have put their heart in these scopes and they all have their
merits, but we had to pick the three best and also the one seen as the most
innovative...

Thanks to all participants and judges, here are the results!
