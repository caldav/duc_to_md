switching](/en/blog/2016/07/11/snapd-2010/)

If it hasn't already, snapd 2.0.10 should be making its way to your 16.04
systems. Here is what’s new!

The 2.0.10 release contains a number of improvements and fixes over the
[_2.0.9
release_](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2016/06/23/snapd-209-full-snap-
confinement-elementary-04/) that was available before. The highlights:

## Channels

Channels (`stable`, `candidate`, `beta`, `edge`) usage has been streamlined on
the client.

As a shorthand to `--channel=<channel>`, you can now use `--<channel>` with
the `refresh` and `install` commands.

For example:

## Interfaces

New interfaces have landed with this release, giving you more freedom to
interact with the OS, while keeping your app into the bounds of the existing
confinement. This allows, for example, for improvements in the VLC snap’s user
experience.

`camera` (new)

  * Grants access to `/dev/video0` (although, note the following issue: [https://pad.lv/1600719](https://pad.lv/1600719))

## Let us know what you think!

We’d like to hear your feedback about snapd and snap technologies. Is there an
interface you would need for your app to be working better? Can we do better
with integrating with a particular distro? Here’s how we can talk:

  * Send an e-mail to the [Snapcraft mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/snapcraft)

  * File [a bug in Snappy](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/)
