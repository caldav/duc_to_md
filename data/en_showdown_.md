## Welcome to the second Ubuntu Scopes Showdown!

#### ⚠ Entry submission ended on feb 29th 2016 ⚠

We are excited to bring you yet another engaging developer competition, where
the Ubuntu app developer community brings innovative and interesting new
experiences for Ubuntu on mobile devices.

Scopes in Javascript and Go have been introduced last year and are the hot
topic of this competition!

## Build a new generation of mobile experiences

Scopes are a complete reinvention of the content and services experience where
you can stop trying to bring the user "in" your app, but simply focus on
bringing the content "out" to the home screen.

### Now made easier with a new JavaScript developer experience

Ubuntu has picked Node.js to bring the existing web goodness and expertise of
the platform to scopes. Node packages from npm are easily integrated into your
scope, speeding up development time and feature integration.
