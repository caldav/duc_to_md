#  [Can I haz MainView in a Window?](/en/blog/2016/05/30/can-i-haz-mainview-window-post/)

When using Unity8 these days connecting a Bluetooth mouse to a device enables
windowed mode. Another option is to connect an external monitor via HDMI and
most recently on some devices wireless displays. This raises a few questions
on the API side of things.

#  [The versioning of the Ubuntu UI Toolkit](/en/blog/2016/05/24/about-versioning-ubuntu-ui-toolkit/)

In the recent days there was lots of discussion about the versioning of the
Ubuntu UI Toolkit. Finally we thought that the topic deserves a dedicated blog
post to clarify the situation and resolve some misunderstandings.

#  [SDK Planning for 16.10](/en/blog/2016/03/16/planning-the-sdk-16-10/)

# **On your mark!**

We have a clear commitment for the upcoming cycle: We will make it faster! One
might ask what exactly we want to make faster and how much faster? From the
point of SDK the most important place for performance improvements are the
applications and all the consumers of the UI Toolkit. So ...

#  [The Next Generation SDK](/en/blog/2015/09/01/next-generation-sdk/)

Up until now the basic architecture of the SDK IDE and tools packaging was
that we have packaged and distributed the QtCreator IDE and our Ubuntu plugins
as separate distro packages which strongly depend on the Qt available in the
same release.

Since 14.04 we have been jumping through hoops to provide the very ...

#  [Sprinting for convergence](/en/blog/2015/06/08/sprinting-convergence/)

Convergence is all around. Our deeply loved UI Toolkit, what was primarily
targeting touch environments is converging to where users might have keyboards
and pointer devices. But that is just one point. The innovative track for
Ubuntu is called Snappy and at the same time the SDK is converging to the
desktop. We move to ...

## **14.04 - 1.0 release**

The 1.0 release of the UITK was built mostly for demonstrative purposes, but

#  [Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Kits But Were Afraid toAsk](/en/blog/2015/03/18/everything-you-always-wanted-know-about-kits-were-afraid-ask/)
