If your app is not free and open source or not targeting [Ubuntu
devices](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/), there are other ways to publish apps
to Ubuntu too:

## Commercial apps or proprietary apps at no cost

If you plan to publish commercial apps,

  * [get your app ready](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/my-apps-packages/),
  * find out how to [submit a commercial app](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/publish-commercial-app/),
  * get an [updated version of your app](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/updating-your-app/) out there,
  * check out our [Commercial software FAQ](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/commercial-software-faqs/),
  * read more about our [License key infrastructure](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/licence-key-infrastructure/).
  * our packaging tutorial: [part 1](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/commercial-apps-packaging-setup/) (Get Set Up and Overview of Debian packaging) and [part 2](/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/commercial-apps-packaging/) (Packaging Software and Additional notes)

## Open source apps at no cost

### Publish in a PPA

Publish your package to a [Personal Package Archive](/en/publish/other-forms-
of-submitting-apps/ppa/). This is a good option if your app already uses
Debian packaging and you want it to be available immediately.

**Note:**

This article refers to publishing third-party desktop applications packaged
with the traditional .deb format.

Ubuntu is migrating to the new .snap format to easily and securely distribute
apps.

devices, [check out the current documentation instead
