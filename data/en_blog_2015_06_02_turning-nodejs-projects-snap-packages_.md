nodejs-projects-snap-packages/)

Thanks to the tireless work of Oliver Grawert we now have a handy tool called
node-snapper which very easily turns your node.js project into a .snap
package. It will automatically take care of bundling required libraries, other
related node.js projects and will make a multi-arch ("fat") package available,
so it will immediately work on armhf and amd64 architectures.

Intrigued? Check out our tutorial [Turning node.js projects into snap
packages](https://developer.ubuntu.com/snappy/tutorials/node-to-snap/).
