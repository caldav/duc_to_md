This is a week full of exciting events in the Ubuntu world! Following on the
series of Ubuntu Scopes Workshops for the Ubuntu Scopes Showdown, we’re
thrilled to announce more Scopes Workshops sessions as part of the Ubuntu
Online Summit.

## Scopes workshops: learn more and ask your questions

In order to support participants of the Scope Showdown, we’re organizing a
series of workshops around different topics on writing scopes. These will be 1
hour hands-on sessions where the presenter will be demonstrating the topic
live on video, with real code and using the Ubuntu SDK.

These are also meant to be interactive, so during and after the session the
presenter will be answering the questions posted in real time by developers on
the chat widget on each session page. Here’s the schedule for the workshops:
