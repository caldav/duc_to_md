#  [Adaptive page layout made flexible](/en/blog/2015/09/11/adaptive-page-

A few weeks ago Tim posted a nice article about [_Adaptive page layouts made
easy_](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2015/08/10/adaptive-page-
layouts/). It is my turn now to continue the series, with the hope that you
will all agree on the title.

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have good news and (slightly) bad news to announce
about the AdaptivePageLayout. If the blogging would ...

#  [The Next Generation SDK](/en/blog/2015/09/01/next-generation-sdk/)

Up until now the basic architecture of the SDK IDE and tools packaging was

## Convergent applications

We want to make it easy for app developers to write an app that can run on
different form factors without changes in the code. This implies that an app
should support screens of various sizes, and the layout of the app should be
optimal for each screen size. For example, a messaging ...
