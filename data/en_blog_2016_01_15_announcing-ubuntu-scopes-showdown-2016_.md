Today we announce the launch of our second Ubuntu Scopes Showdown! We are
excited to bring you yet another engaging developer competition, where the
Ubuntu app developer community brings innovative and interesting new
experiences for Ubuntu on mobile devices.

Scopes in Javascript and Go were introduced recently and are the hot topic of
this competition!

Contestants will have six weeks to build and publish their Unity8 scopes to
the store using the Ubuntu SDK and Scopes API (JavaScript, Go or C++),
starting Monday January 18th.

A great number of exciting prizes are up for grabs: a System76 Meerkat
computer, BQ E5 Ubuntu phones, Steam Controllers, Steam Link, Raspberry Pi 2
and convergence packs for Ubuntu phones!

Find out [_more details on how to enter thecompetition_](https://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown). Good luck and get
developing! We look forward to seeing your scopes on our Ubuntu homescreens!
