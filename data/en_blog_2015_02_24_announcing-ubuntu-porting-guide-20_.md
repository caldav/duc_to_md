In the last few weeks, Ubuntu has reached a major milestone with the first
flash sales of the BQ Aquarius - Ubuntu Edition. This is only the beginning of
seeing Ubuntu on a wider selection of phones and tablets, and thanks to an
incredibly enthusiast porting community, more devices have been part of that
show. Some of these skilled porters have even set up [their own imageserver](http://system-image.tasemnice.eu/) to provide updates over-the-air!

To ease the porting process, the **[PortingGuide](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/ubuntu-for-devices/porting-new-device/)** has been updated to reflect the current procedure of enabling new
devices. From setting up your dev environment, to configuring the kernel and
debugging AppArmor, it covers the main points of making a fully working port.
Currently focusing on AOSP ports, it will be extended in due time to detail
CyanogenMod-specific processes.

If you are interested in porting, please make sure you provide feedback on any
issues and roadblocks that could arise, either on
[Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/developer-ubuntu-com/+bugs) or on [theubuntu-phone mailing-list](https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/).

Thank you and good work, fellow devices adventurers!
