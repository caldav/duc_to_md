As a developer, you probably want to see your apps in many hands. One way to
make it happen is to enable your application for translation.

With minimal effort, you can mark your application strings for translation,
expose them to community translators and integrate these translations into
your package. The translations building process is handled by the SDK itself
and if you happen to use Launchpad, translators will quickly see your project
and help you, but you still need to mark your user-visible strings as
translatable.
