Following the announcement of [snaps being supported across a range of keyLinux distributions](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/06/14/universal-snap-packages-launch-on-multiple-linux-distros), the development teams working on
snaps and Snapcraft are **making universal snaps one of the main topics of
their next sprint in Heidelberg, Germany, from 18-22 July**.

Snappy sprints are face-to-face events where multiple teams working on snap
technologies, including Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth, get together to
plan, design and develop their next release and longer term roadmap. After the
initial positive reception amongst initial adopters, tech media and wider open
source community, continuous improvement of the snap user and developer
experience is a major focus.

A number of upstreams, contributors and developers of leading open source
projects such as **Debian**, **Elementary OS**, **Fedora**, **KDE**,
**Kubuntu**, **MATE** or **VLC** have already confirmed participation at the
sprint to collaborate on better distro-agnostic snap support.

At this point, we'd like to **extend this invitation to contributors** of
other projects to influence the roadmap and work together on shaping up the
universal snaps story. If you are interested in participating, we have a
limited amount of seats available at the sprint, subject to review and
confirmation. Should they need it, sponsorship for travel and accommodation
will be available for a set of contributors of upstreams, distros or desktop
projects who are willing to actively work towards this goal.

If the answer is yes, feel free to [apply for participation and sponsorship tothe Heidelberg snappy sprint](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sBovCdRb8oKCEVvA69mHX2Ty1RPxxrN3REj6RiRaBCs/viewform)

Please note that a sprint is not a tech conference: it is a set of focused
working and planning sessions where the snappy Engineering team execute work
items and plan the next iteration of snapd and Snapcraft. Attendees will be
expected to actively participate in discussions and decision making and be
willing to take work items where appropriate.

Also do note that while all contributions are valuable, we have a limited
capacity to sponsor participants and we cannot support everyone. As such,
sponsorship will be subject to review and final confirmation. Once the
requests are in, we will review all of the applicants and contact you as soon
as possible to let you know if your request for sponsorship has been approved.

It will be a great chance to build together app distribution across platforms
and weâ€™ll be looking forward to working with you!
