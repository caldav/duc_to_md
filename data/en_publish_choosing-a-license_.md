There are many different license models available for software, but the choice
is not as complicated as it first sounds. There are three major traits of
licenses you might be interested in.

**1) Sharing improvements**

The GNU Public License (GPL [V2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or
[V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)) might fit your needs best, as
it requires anyone who distributes your work (or derivatives of it) to publish
it under the same terms as you did. V3 is similar to V2, but further restricts
use in hardware that forbids software alterations. Linux, Git, and WordPress
use the GPL.

**2) Simplicity and permissiveness**

If you want a simple license which allows users of your code to do whatever
they want with it as long as they attribute back to you and don't hold you
liable, you might be interested in the [MIT license](http://mit-license.org/).
jQuery and Rails use the MIT License.

**3) Concern about patents**

The [Apache License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache/) is a
permissive license similar to the MIT License, but also provides an express
grant of patent rights from contributors to users. Apache, SVN, and NuGet use
the Apache License.

**Other licenses**

There are many [other licenses](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/)
available, but if you want to stay compatible with Ubuntu, you might want to
pick a license which is considered free by the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses).
