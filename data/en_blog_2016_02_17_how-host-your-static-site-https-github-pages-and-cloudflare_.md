There has been a [growing](https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/why-your-site-should-be-using-https) [movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhZ6S0PFCY)
to get all websites to use SSL connections where possible. Nowadays, Google
even [uses it as acriterion](https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html) for ranking websites.

I've written before about [how to host an HTTPS website for free with StartSSLand OpenShift](https://robinwinslow.uk/2014/08/26/host-your-site-with-https-for-free/). However, StartSSL is very hard to use and provides very basic
certificates, and setting up a website on OpenShift is a fairly technical
undertaking.

There now exists [a much simpler way to setup an HTTPSwebsite](https://sheharyar.me/blog/free-ssl-for-github-pages-with-custom-domains/) with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and [GitHubPages](https://pages.github.com/). This only works for static sites.

If your site is more complicated and needs a database or dynamic
functionality, or you need an SHA-1 fallback certificate (explained below)
then look at my other post about [the OpenShift solution](/2014/08/26/host-your-site-with-https-for-free/). However, if a static site works for you, read
on.

# GitHub Pages

As most developers will be aware by now, GitHub offer a fantastic free static
website hosting solution in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

All you have to do is [put your HTML files in the `gh-pages`branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/) of
one of your repositories and they will be served as a website at
`{username}.github.io/{project-name}`.

![GitHub pages minimal files](http://i.imgur.com/DBeJSBN.png)

And all files are passed through the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) parser
first, so if you want to split up your HTML into templates you can. And if you
don't want to craft your site by hand, you can use the [Automatic PageGenerator](https://github.com/blog/1081-instantly-beautiful-project-pages).

![automatic page generator themes](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d60800ddc54bf9d0317ca901e7fb14590167f7fd/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622d696d616765732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f626c6f672f323031322f706167652d67656e657261746f722d7069636b65722e706e67)

Websites on `github.io` also [support HTTPS](https://konklone.com/post/github-pages-now-sorta-supports-https-so-use-it), so you can serve your site up at
`https://{username}.github.io/{project-name}` if you want.

![mytestwebsite GitHub pages](http://i.imgur.com/2ZvKJEP.png)

GitHub Pages also [support customdomains](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) (still for free). Just add a `CNAME` file to the repository
with your domain name in it - e.g. `mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk` - and then
go and setup the [DNS CNAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) to
point to `{username}.github.io`.

![mytestwebsite GitHub pages files](http://i.imgur.com/7EF2uwyg.png)

The only thing you can't do directly with GitHub Pages is offer HTTPS on your
custom domain - e.g. `https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`. This is where
CloudFlare comes in.

# CloudFlare

CloudFlare offer a really quite impressive free DNS and CDN service. This free
service includes some really impressive offerings, the first three of which
are especially helpful for our current HTTPS mission:

  * [Free automatic HTTPS for your domain](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/) - no need to buy a certificate
  * [Page Rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168306-Is-there-a-tutorial-for-Page-Rules-) - custom settings and redirects for URL patterns
  * [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enforce-web-policy-with-hypertext-strict-transport-security-hsts/) (HSTS) - protection from [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
  * [DNSSEC](https://www.cloudflare.com/dnssec/universal-dnssec/) - protection from DNS poisoning attacks
  * [HTTP/2](https://www.cloudflare.com/http2/) - optimised connections for browsers that support it
  * [CNAME flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/) - so you can use a [DNS CNAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) at the domain apex
  * ["Always online" protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/always-online/) - Your cached website will stay up even if the host goes down
  * [Firewall](https://www.cloudflare.com/features-security/) - intelligent protection against [DDOS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)

The most important downside to CloudFlare's free tier SSL is that it doesn't
include the [fall-back to legacy SHA-1 for olderbrowsers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sha-1-deprecation-no-browser-left-behind/). This means that the most out-of-date (and therefore probably the
poorest) 1.5% of global citizens won't be able to access your site without
upgrading their browser. If this is important to you, either find a different
HTTPS solution or upgrade to a [paid CloudFlareaccount](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/).

## Setting up HTTPS

Because CloudFlare are a CDN _and_ a DNS host, they can do the HTTPS
negotiation for you. They've taken advantage of this to provide you with a
free HTTPS certificate to encrypt communication between your users and their
cached site.

First simply setup your DNS with CloudFlare to point to
`{username}.github.io`, and allow CloudFlare to cache the site.

![mytestwebsite CloudFlare DNS setup](http://i.imgur.com/VxPqzgFg.png)

Between CloudFlare and your host the connection doesn't have to be encrypted,
but I would certainly suggest that it still should be. But crucially for us,
this encrypted connection doesn't actually need a _valid_ HTTPS certificate.
To enable this we should select the "Full" (rather than "Flexible" or
"Strict") option.

![CloudFlare full SSL encryption](http://i.imgur.com/olf2JH2g.png)

Et voil√†! You now have an encrypted custom domain in front of GitHub Pages
completely for free!

![mytestwebsite with a secure domain](http://i.imgur.com/eBgFJqp.png)

# Ensuring all visitors use HTTPS

To make our site properly secure, we need to ensure all users are sent to the
HTTPS site (`https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`) instead of the HTTP one
(`http://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`).

## Setting up a page rule

The first step to get visitors to use HTTPS is to send a [301redirect](https://moz.com/learn/seo/redirection) from
`http://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk` to
`https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`.

Although this is not supported with GitHub Pages, it [can beachieved](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170536-How-do-I-redirect-all-visitors-to-HTTPS-SSL-) with CloudFlare page rules.

Just add a page rule for `http://*{your-domain.com}/*` (e.g.
`http://*robinwinslow.uk/*`) and turn on "Always use HTTPS":

![CloudFlare always use HTTPS page rule](http://i.imgur.com/1l6tyIAg.png)

Now we can check that our domain is redirecting users to HTTPS by inspecting
the headers:

    
    $ curl -I mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    ...
    Location: https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk/

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

To protect our users from [man-in-the-middleattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), we should
also turn on [HSTS with CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enforce-web-policy-with-hypertext-strict-transport-security-hsts/) (still for free). Note
that this can cause problems if you're ever planning on removing HTTPS from
your site.

If you're using a subdomain (e.g. `mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`), remember
to enable "Apply HSTS policy to subdomains".

![CloudFlare: HSTS setting](http://i.imgur.com/tYam5yng.png)

This will tell [modernbrowsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stricttransportsecurity) to always use the
HTTPS protocol for this domain.

    
    $ curl -I https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ...
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains; preload
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

It can take several weeks for your domain to make it into the [Chromium HSTSpreload list](https://hstspreload.appspot.com/). You can check if it's in
there, or add it again, by visiting `chrome://net-internals/#hsts` in a Chrome
or Chromium browser and looking for the `static_sts_domain` setting.

# That's it!

You now have an incredibly quick and easy way to put a fully secure website
online in minutes, totally for free! (Apart from the domain name).
