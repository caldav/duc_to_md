The 5 weeks after the Ubuntu Scopes Showdown announcement are coming to an
end, it's time to start putting the pencils down and submitting your scopes
for the judges to do their reviews. While you've still got two days to fix
some bugs and do some final polish, the 3rd of December is the last day for
submissions to be accepted for the Showdown. Remember that to qualify, you'll
need to:

**Register** your scope for the contest

**Submit** your scope to the Ubuntu Software Store

## Registering your scope

To register your scope for the judges' review, you'll simply need a couple of
minutes to fill in the registration form. It might be worth filling it in
advance, even if you are planning to upload your app at the last minute. You
can submit the form now and still upload new revisions of your app until the
3rd of December. Register your scope for participation

## Submitting your scope

Submitting your scope to the store should also be quick and easy. The upload
workflow is exactly the same as for apps, and with automated reviews it takes
just a few minutes from upload to your scope being available for everyone on
the Ubuntu Software Store. To ensure your scope is discoverable and looks
good, you might want to check out the scope upload tips › And when you're
ready to start the upload, you can follow the 5-step process to get it
published ›
