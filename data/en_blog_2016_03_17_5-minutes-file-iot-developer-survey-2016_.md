A quick note reminding you to submit your feedback to the [IoT DeveloperSurvey 2016](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AGILEIoT)!

![](/static/devportal_uploaded/8f149a1e-d82e-414e-872d-fe622bf55b52-3078ae78-ed49-442d-9ac4-8228c968aeaf-media/2016/03/17/survey.jpg)

The survey is organized by the Eclipse IoT Working Group, IEEE IoT Initiative
and the AGILE-IoT H2020 Research Project. Your input will help in
understanding the IoT community requirements on software and related tools and
to develop resources to more effectively help developers working on the
Internet of Things.

This will help as well driving our [snappy Ubuntu Core IoTexperience](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/), in parternship with
those great open source projects!

The deadline to participate is March 25, 2016.
