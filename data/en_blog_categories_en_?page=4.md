There has been a [growing](https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/why-your-site-
should-be-using-https) [movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhZ6S0PFCY)
to get all websites to use SSL connections where possible. Nowadays, Google
even [uses it as a
criterion](https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/https-as-
ranking-signal.html) for ranking websites.

I've written before about [how to host an HTTPS website for free with StartSSL
and OpenShift](https://robinwinslow.uk/2014/08/26/host-your-site-with-https-
for-free/). However, StartSSL is very hard to use and provides very basic

I often find myself wanting to play around with a tiny Python web application
with native Python without installing any extra modules - the Python
developer's equivalent of creating an `index.html` and opening it in the
browser [just to play around with
markup](http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/myfirstsite/myfirstpage.html).

For example, today I found myself wanting to inspect how the [Google

Up until now the basic architecture of the SDK IDE and tools packaging was
that we have packaged and distributed the QtCreator IDE and our Ubuntu plugins
