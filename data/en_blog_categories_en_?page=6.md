your package. The translations building process is ...

#  [A magnifying glass in QML](/en/blog/2015/04/28/magnifying-glass-qml/)

To create sharp visual components, we need to make sure our renderings look
good at the pixel level. This is a common task and the terms _precision_ and
_pixel-perfectness_ have become ubiquitous in discussions among programmers
and designers at Canonical. In the last years, the industry started to

From time to time app developers ask how to manually build click packages from
their QMake or CMake projects. To understand the answer to that question,
knowing about how the SDK does things internally and the tools it uses helps a
lot.

First we have to know about the _click_ command. It is one of ...

So if you are new to QtCreator the first thing that freaks you out will be the
concept of Kits. Yes it does look complicated, big and you might want to ask
why do I need this.

The theming engine is one of the least documented features of Ubuntu UI
Toolkit. While we are preparing to create the third generation theming engine,
which will support sub-theming and runtime palette color customizations, there
are more and more app developers asking about how to create their own theme
