So you had a look into Ubuntu App Development, you liked what you saw and want
to show your friends? Maybe you want to give a workshop at school, at
university, at your LoCo team or your LUG? You're interested in showing this
you to your colleagues at work? Great!





## Materials

We have [some materials prepared for you](https://drive.google.com/a/canonical.com/#folders/0B2SKL58Ipf7eeEdpYW5SdVlUU3M). You can choose from a number of
different materials. There are a lot of speaker notes throughout the materials
and we went through a couple of iterations already to iron out issues. Still
it will help if you take some time to familiarise yourself with the content
before you present.

**Introductory presentations:**

  1. introduce everyone to [Ubuntu for devices](https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/presentation/d/1Xa7hNm6iPi5dbfH312m5zvDzEofMMGAAU_zyKyEPzJw/edit?usp=drive_web)
  2. get people up to speed on [what the SDK is, how the platform is organised, and get everyone set up](https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/presentation/d/1-OcIOjMSdiLI6JdBbuhobKkxdZRaaggeA-eSOoA5cnE/edit)
  3. give everyone a [quick overview of QML and our design building blocks](https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/presentation/d/1KEGJEm4IWr06Rn-rB8q4R6CI_nTcJ94lu_ZbKdEc0ro/edit?usp=drive_web)

Alternatively, if you're hard pressed for time, you can (instead of steps 1-3)
give  instead.

**Workshops:**

  * â€‹let everyone work, in their own pace, [on their first ever Ubuntu app](https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/document/d/1jgn1nJeBjgQO3RzDMZ44wM606u6u02U6bVgtaSHkUA0/edit?usp=drive_web).
  * and/or: let everyone work, in their own pace, on [their first ever Ubuntu (HTML5) app](https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/document/d/1ThAiOoD3Wrk4Z5nAWy7pbhKEvsQWPsCq9ZcpN-DzjUM/edit).
  * and/or: let everyone work, in their own pace, on [their first ever Ubuntu scope](https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/document/d/1n8t7EcfLkT2nCSm0WZRKL59XM4kCM6ShD_Gv5wz-ofM/edit).

If you have questions or feedback, we're all ears. [Let usknow](http://developer.ubuntu.com/community).





## Not using Ubuntu?

If you are thinking of organising [an event to teach Ubuntu AppDevelopment](/en/community/training/) you might have a number of people who
don't run Ubuntu on their laptop. If that's the case, you might want to let
them know in advance that they can run Ubuntu in a virtual machine. If you are
running OS X or Windows, please follow these steps to use Ubuntu as a virtual
machine (just make sure you have enough space available on your machine). This
way you won't have to install Ubuntu natively on your laptop.

  1. Download [the ISO file](http://people.canonical.com/~dpm/ISO/). _(15.04 will give you the latest development tools, which are useful for ie. developing scopes.)_
  2. Burn it either to a DVD or USB stick: 
    * Windows instructions: [DVD](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-windows), [USB](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows).
    * Mac OS X: [DVD](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-mac-osx), [USB](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx).
    * Ubuntu: [DVD](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-ubuntu), [USB](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu).

_Note:_ The user name on the image is "ubuntu" and the password is "ubuntu" as
well.
