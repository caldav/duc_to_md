## Set up your My Apps account

My Apps will help you submit your apps to the Ubuntu Software Centre and it
will give you an overview of their status. You will be able to see stats for
each app, such as downloads and sales.

## Package up your application ready to upload

Before your application can be accepted to the Ubuntu Software Centre, it must
be packaged in a standard format. In Ubuntu, this means Debian packaging.
Canonical provides this packaging service free of charge for commercial apps.
However, to package your software properly, it must meet a set of simple
requirements.

## Prepare your application icons and screenshots

You only need to upload a 64x64 pixel icon, but your app will be more likely
to be seen and downloaded if you pay special attention to this step. Make sure
you include a representative screenshot and the full range of icon sizes.

## Add your application details

To help people find your app, we'll ask you to choose a category, include a
detailed description and some keywords to aid search. You'll also need to
choose a licence (including open source and proprietary software). It's also
important that you add a URL where users can contact you.

## Choose your price

Not all software is free in the Software Centre. If you are charging for your
app, you'll need to provide details of your Paypal account, a phone number and
a postal address. The minimum price you can charge is $2.99. **Note:** for
mobile apps in the Software Store Beta, payments are not yet enabled, so stay
tuned for updates on when you can start charging for your app.

## Your app will be reviewed

Once you've submitted your app, it will go through the review process. We will
be in touch to help ensure your app makes it to the Software Store.
