#  [Ubuntu SDK meets snapcraft](/en/blog/2016/11/16/ubuntu-sdk-ide-meets-snapcraft/)

Everyone who has followed Ubuntu lately for sure stumbled across the snappy
technology, which does not only bring the new cross-distro packaging format

## Background

Integrating desktop applications with snaps has been a little bit challenging
in terms of getting them looking and behaving as part of the system. This
means following general desktop theming, having global application menu
integration, getting the icon caches, getting configuration keys and such.
Also, the technologies and toolkits like GTK, Qt, demand a little bit of
expertise on ...
