A few weeks ago we participated to [Phonegap Day EU2016](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/). It was a great opportunity to meet
with the Cordova development team and app developers gathered for this
occasion.

We demo'ed the latest Ubuntu 16.04 LTS release, running on a brand new BQ M10
tablet in convergence mode. It was really interesting to discuss with app
developers. Creating responsive user interfaces is already a common topic for
web developers, and Cordova developers by extension.

On the second day, we hosted a workshop on developing Ubuntu applications with
Cordova and popular frameworks like [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/).
[Alexandre Abreu](https://launchpad.net/~abreu-alexandre) also showed his new
[cordova-plugin-ble-central](https://github.com/cordova-ubuntu/cordova-plugin-ble-central) for Ubuntu. This one lets you connect to an IoT device, like one
of those new RPI boards, directly to an Ubuntu app using the Bluetooth Low
Energy stack. Snappy, Ubuntu and Cordova all working together !

Last but not least, we started the release process for cordova-ubuntu 4.3.4.
This is the latest stable update to the Ubuntu platform support code for
Cordova apps. It's coming along with a set of documentation updates available
here and on the [upstream cordova doc site](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/dev/guide/platforms/ubuntu/index.html).

We've made a quick video to summarize this and walk you through the first
steps of creating your own Ubuntu app using Cordova. You can now watch it at:

Let us know about your ideas : we're eager to see what you can do with the new
release and plugins.
