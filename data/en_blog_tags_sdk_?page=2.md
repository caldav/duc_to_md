#  [UI Toolkit for OTA9](/en/blog/2016/02/01/ui-toolkit-ota9/)

Hello folks, it’s been a while since the last update came from our busy
toolkit ants. As OTA9 came out recently, it is the time for a refreshment from
our side to show you the latest and greatest cocktail of features our barmen
have prepared. Beside the bugfixes we’ve provided, here is a list of ...

#  [Here comes the brand new Ubuntu SDK IDE tools](/en/blog/2015/11/19/here-comes-brand-new-ubuntu-sdk-ide-tools/)

In the last couple of weeks, we had to completely rework the packaging for the
SDK tools and jump through hoops to bring the same experience to everyone
regardless if they are on LTS or the development version of Ubuntu. It was not
easy but we finally are ready to hand this beauty to the ...

#  [Adaptive page layout made flexible](/en/blog/2015/09/11/adaptive-page-layout-made-flexible/)

A few weeks ago Tim posted a nice article about [_Adaptive page layouts madeeasy_](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2015/08/10/adaptive-page-layouts/). It is my turn now to continue the series, with the hope that you
will all agree on the title.

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have good news and (slightly) bad news to announce
about the AdaptivePageLayout. If the blogging would ...

#  [The Next Generation SDK](/en/blog/2015/09/01/next-generation-sdk/)

Up until now the basic architecture of the SDK IDE and tools packaging was
that we have packaged and distributed the QtCreator IDE and our Ubuntu plugins
as separate distro packages which strongly depend on the Qt available in the
same release.

Since 14.04 we have been jumping through hoops to provide the very ...

## Convergent applications

We want to make it easy for app developers to write an app that can run on
different form factors without changes in the code. This implies that an app
should support screens of various sizes, and the layout of the app should be
optimal for each screen size. For example, a messaging ...

#  [Sprinting for convergence](/en/blog/2015/06/08/sprinting-convergence/)

Convergence is all around. Our deeply loved UI Toolkit, what was primarily
targeting touch environments is converging to where users might have keyboards
and pointer devices. But that is just one point. The innovative track for
Ubuntu is called Snappy and at the same time the SDK is converging to the
desktop. We move to ...

#  [Keeping track of evolving QML components](/en/blog/2015/05/26/keeping-track-evolving-qml-components/)

We all love QML because it allows for fast prototyping, and not only that,
it's a very efficient tool for production applications. The complexity of C
and C++ is hidden behind neat and simple API. Many if not most app developers
these days take advantage of that without even having to know the
implementation details ...

#  [A magnifying glass in QML](/en/blog/2015/04/28/magnifying-glass-qml/)

To create sharp visual components, we need to make sure our renderings look
good at the pixel level. This is a common task and the terms _precision_ and
_pixel-perfectness_ have become ubiquitous in discussions among programmers
and designers at Canonical. In the last years, the industry started to
increase the pixel density of screens, _again_ (remember the ...

#  [Retrospective and roadmap of the UIToolkit](/en/blog/2015/04/15/retrospective-and-roadmap-ui-toolkit/)

## **14.04 - 1.0 release**

The 1.0 release of the UITK was built mostly for demonstrative purposes, but
works well to a certain extent, it is the LTS release after all. Available
from the Trusty archive ([0.1.46+14.04.20140408.1-0ubuntu1](http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/trusty/ubuntu-ui-toolkit)) and from the SDK PPA
([0.1.46+14.10.20140520-0ubuntu1 ...](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+sourcepub/4190958/+listing-archive-extra)

](/en/blog/2015/04/13/inner-workings-sdk/)

From time to time app developers ask how to manually build click packages from
their QMake or CMake projects. To understand the answer to that question,
knowing about how the SDK does things internally and the tools it uses helps a
lot.

First we have to know about the _click_ command. It is one of ...
