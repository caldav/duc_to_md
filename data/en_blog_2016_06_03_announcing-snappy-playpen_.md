[Snappy Playpen is on Github](https://github.com/ubuntu/snappy-playpen) and
it's where we want to work together on snapping new software. This will
provide excellent examples to new users of snapcraft, we will be able to
document best practices, learn from each other and create an incubator for new
snaps to be added to the store.

Snappy Playpen won't be a collection of production-ready snaps, we are
treating it a bit like a combination of research project and documentation.

If you are curious, just check out our main [githubpage](https://github.com/ubuntu/snappy-playpen) and read the docs there. It's
easy and we're quite accessible. Find us on gitter, IRC or the mailing list to
find out how to get involved.

You can get started at any time and contribute whatever you feel makes sense,
but we want to host themed "sprint" weeks as well. If you have suggestions
(e.g. a IoT-related week, a KDE-related week, server app, etc.), let us know.
For those weeks we will make sure we have experts there to help us figure this
out together.

Next week will be our first Snappy Playpen _sprint_ and it will be a "free for
all" week. This will help us to figure out the details and learn about what
you all exactly want to do.

On Tuesday, 7th June 2016, we will make a big push and make sure our snapd and
snapcraft engineers are there to answer questions and help figure out
solutions together. Mark the day in your calendar and check out our docs to
find out how to get started.

  * WHAT: Snappy playpen sprint
  * WHEN: Tuesday, 7th June 2016 all day
  * WHERE: Join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ubuntu/snappy-playpen) or [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=snappy)
