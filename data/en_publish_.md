## Package up your content ready to upload

If you are using the Software Store, the Ubuntu SDK makes it very easy to
generate packages which can be used in Ubuntu. You simply need to pay
attention to a few simple steps along the way and you are almost there.

## Prepare the icons and screenshots

You only need to upload a 256×256 pixel icon, but your app or scope will be
more likely to be seen and downloaded if you pay special attention to this
step. Make sure you include a representative screenshot and the full range of
icon sizes.
